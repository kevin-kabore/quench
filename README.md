### Approach Taken

Began with a wireframe, Trello board, and Inception deck presentation. We then created a Git hub organization for our group and then created a repository for the project.

### Installation and Start up instructions

Fork the project from this Git hub repository. Clone the project to make a local version on your machine. Once your you can see a cloned version on Quench on your git repository list, cd into the project in your command line, and run the command:

$npm install

Then your free to edit your local version of Quench!

### Next Steps

Our original goal was to incorporate a third party API into our project such as Yelp. A next step would be to use this third party API to filter drinks by location.
